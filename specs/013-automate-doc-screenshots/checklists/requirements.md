# Specification Quality Checklist: Automated Documentation Screenshots & Content Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The term "Playwright MCP" appears in requirements, which references a
  tooling approach rather than an implementation technology. This is
  acceptable because the constitution explicitly mandates this tooling
  (Principle XI), and the spec needs to reference it for traceability.
  The underlying behavior described (navigate, interact, capture) is
  technology-agnostic in spirit.
- All eight functional requirements are directly traceable to user story
  acceptance scenarios and success criteria.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — scope is well-defined
  by the constitution amendments and existing Confluence page structure.
