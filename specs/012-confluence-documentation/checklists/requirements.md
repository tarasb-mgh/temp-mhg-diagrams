## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- This feature is documentation/process-oriented rather than code-oriented.
  Implementation will primarily involve Confluence space setup and page
  creation, not application code changes.
- The spec aligns with Constitution Principle XI (Documentation Standards)
  which was ratified in constitution v3.5.0.
